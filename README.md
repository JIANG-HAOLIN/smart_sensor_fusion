* Second, unzip and rename the folder to ```data```, and place it under the project folder ```smart_sensor_fusion```
* Third, preprocess the data by running ```python utils/h5py_convert.py```
* Fourth, to split the training/testing dataset, run ```python utils/split_train_val.py```
* Brief explanation for the example dataset: Under data/test_recordings, each folder is an episode. timestamps.json contains the human demo actions and the pose history of the robot, while each subfolder contains a stream of sensory inputs.
